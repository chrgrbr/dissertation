An equalized pressure intensity allows a correct exploitation of the ultrasound contrast agent injected into the human body and, in turn, permits one to fully exploit its nonlinear response. A stochastic method of synthesis (based on the simulated annealing scheme) that is able to produce the desired transmission beam profile, acting simultaneously on the carrier frequencies of the acoustic pulses emitted by the array's transducers and on the apodizing weights, has been developed and assessed. The results obtained by the joint optimization, in terms of acoustic pressure profile, sidelobe level, and main lobe shape, are reported, discussed, and compared with those obtained by the traditional emission strategy and by the exclusive optimization of the apodizing weights or the carrier frequencies. A significant improvement of the ultrasound beam generated by the joint optimization over those generated by the exclusive optimization is pointed out.}},

Optimized MR images can be reformatted from T1, T2, and proton density (PD) values to achieve maximum tissue contrast between joint fluid and adjacent soft tissue. To demonstrate the method for optimization of TR and TE by synthetic MRI and to validate the optimized images by comparison with conventional shoulder MR arthrography (MRA) images. Thirty-seven shoulder MRA images acquired by synthetic MRI were retrospectively evaluated for PD, T1, and T2 values at the joint fluid and glenoid labrum. Differences in signal intensity between the fluid and labrum were observed between TR of 500–6000 ms and TE of 80–300 ms in T2-weighted (T2W) images. Conventional T2W and synthetic images were analyzed for diagnostic agreement of supraspinatus tendon abnormalities (kappa statistics) and image quality scores (one-way analysis of variance with post-hoc analysis). Optimized mean values of TR and TE were 2724.7 ± 1634.7 and 80.1 ± 0.4, respectively. Diagnostic agreement for supraspinatus tendon abnormalities between conventional and synthetic MR images was excellent (κ = 0.882). The mean image quality score of the joint space in optimized synthetic images was significantly higher compared with those in conventional and synthetic images (2.861 ± 0.351 vs. 2.556 ± 0.607 vs. 2.750 ± 0.439; P < 0.05). Synthetic MRI with optimized TR and TE for shoulder MRA enables optimization of soft-tissue contrast.}},

The conventional diffusion encoding sequence, the single pulsed field gradient, has recently been challenged as more general gradient waveforms have been introduced. Out of these, we focus on q-space trajectory imaging, which generalizes the scalar b-value to a tensor valued entity. To take full advantage of its capabilities, it is imperative to respect the constraints imposed by the hardware, while at the same time maximizing the diffusion encoding strength. We provide a tool that achieves this by solving a constrained optimization problem that accommodates constraints on maximum gradient amplitude, slew rate, coil heating and positioning of radio frequency pulses. The method’s efficacy and flexibility is demonstrated both experimentally and by comparison with previous work on optimization of isotropic diffusion sequences.}},
