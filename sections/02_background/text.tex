\section{Learning, Artificial Learning and Generalization}
    how does learning work?
    what is generalization in learning?

    \subsection{Deep Learning}
        how does deep learning work?
        what are the challenges for generalization in artificial and deep learning?
        How is that equal to learning and generalization in learning, where does it differ?

    \subsection{Generalization in Deep Learning: Current discussion and challenges}
        What are the current approaches in deep learning? How is the idea of AGI related to our gerneralization approach? What can be problems of AGI and why do we analyse generalization in a limited scope such as medical image analysis?



    And now that we know how artificial learning works and what generalization is, we can transfer this knowledge to medical deep learning.

\section{Generalization in the Medical Image Analysis Pipeline}
    What special properties apply for medical imaging?
    What makes Generalization hard?
    What can be done to achieve generalization in each of the steps?

    \subsection{Data Acquisition}
    \subsection{Data Curation and Preprocessing}
        \subsubsection{Modalities}
        \subsubsection{Scanners}
            Histograms
    \subsection{Model Building}
        \subsubsection{Convolutional Models}
            Kernels

    \subsection{Model Application and Evaluation}

    Now that we know what is special about medical deep learning and what has been done in the field, we know what is possible and missing and this is our starting point to present our methods in the context of these methods.
