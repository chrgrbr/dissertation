abstract={Utilizing pigeons tested the hypothesis that a relationship exists between the discriminability of spectrum colors and stimulus generalization along the wave-length continuum. "Bidirectional generalization gradients were obtained from measures of response rate during extinction. These gradients were of highly comparable forms for the various spectral regions tested. The results open the possibility of an independence between the generalization decrement and the discriminability of stimuli{\ldots} . A close correspondence was found between changes in the form of the gradient during extinction and changes associated with individual differences in response strength."

  author   = "Martin, S J and Grimwood, P D and Morris, R G",
  abstract = "Changing the strength of connections between neurons is widely
              assumed to be the mechanism by which memory traces are encoded
              and stored in the central nervous system. In its most general
              form, the synaptic plasticity and memory hypothesis states that
              ``activity-dependent synaptic plasticity is induced at
              appropriate synapses during memory formation and is both
              necessary and sufficient for the information storage underlying
              the type of memory mediated by the brain area in which that
              plasticity is observed.'' We outline a set of criteria by which
              this hypothesis can be judged and describe a range of
              experimental strategies used to investigate it. We review both
              classical and newly discovered properties of synaptic plasticity
              and stress the importance of the neural architecture and synaptic
              learning rules of the network in which it is embedded. The
              greater part of the article focuses on types of memory mediated
              by the hippocampus, amygdala, and cortex. We conclude that a
              wealth of data supports the notion that synaptic plasticity is
              necessary for learning and memory, but that little data currently
              supports the notion of sufficiency.",

  abstract = "Most aspects of nervous system development and function rely on
              the continuous crosstalk between neurons and the variegated
              universe of non-neuronal cells surrounding them. The most
              extraordinary property of this cellular community is its ability
              to undergo adaptive modifications in response to environmental
              cues originating from inside or outside the body. Such ability,
              known as neuronal plasticity, allows long-lasting modifications
              of the strength, composition and efficacy of the connections
              between neurons, which constitutes the biochemical base for
              learning and memory. Nerve cells communicate with each other
              through both wiring (synaptic) and volume transmission of
              signals. It is by now clear that glial cells, and in particular
              astrocytes, also play critical roles in both modes by releasing
              different kinds of molecules (e.g., D-serine secreted by
              astrocytes). On the other hand, neurons produce factors that can
              regulate the activity of glial cells, including their ability to
              release regulatory molecules. In the last fifteen years it has
              been demonstrated that both neurons and glial cells release
              extracellular vesicles (EVs) of different kinds, both in
              physiologic and pathological conditions. Here we discuss the
              possible involvement of EVs in the events underlying learning and
              memory, in both physiologic and pathological conditions.",
