abstract={Utilizing pigeons tested the hypothesis that a relationship exists between the discriminability of spectrum colors and stimulus generalization along the wave-length continuum. "Bidirectional generalization gradients were obtained from measures of response rate during extinction. These gradients were of highly comparable forms for the various spectral regions tested. The results open the possibility of an independence between the generalization decrement and the discriminability of stimuli{\ldots} . A close correspondence was found between changes in the form of the gradient during extinction and changes associated with individual differences in response strength."
